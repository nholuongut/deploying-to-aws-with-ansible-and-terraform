This repo will contain code used and taught in the A Cloud Guru course named above.

This course was originally created before Terrafom 0.13 was released however I have updated it to work with version 0.13 in the `terraform_v13_compatible_code` folder.


------

For following along using Terraform 0.12 refer to the `aws_la_cloudplayground_multiple_workers_version`.

Again, for following along using Terraform 0.13 refer to the `terraform_v13_compatible_code`.

Although the folder naming convention in this repository should make sense for the most part, it was primarily created to be referred through the lessons on the A Cloud Guru website.
